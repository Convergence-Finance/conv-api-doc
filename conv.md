Project Introduction

Launched in 2021, Convergence Finance is a decentralized interchangeable assets protocol designed to bridge real-world asset exposure with the liquidity of decentralized finance (DeFi). It essentially allows DeFi participants to gain exposure to real-world assets. 

Convergence will be the first automated market maker (AMM) to make real-world asset exposure interchangeable in the DeFi space by connecting novel Wrapped Security Tokens (WSTs) with utility tokens on a single interface that is adaptable and composable with other DeFi protocols.

The CONV token is Convergence Financeâ€™s native platform token has several main functions, these include: i) governance rights, ii) ConvergenceAMM transaction fee sharing, iii) privileged access to new deals.
